My blog post on the project: https://sophiehlee2.wixsite.com/dsblog/post/visualizing-crimes-in-new-orleans

## Introduction
Analyzing the trends of the crimes from 2018 in New Orleans using Python. This analysis is focused on visualizing the statistics of the crime data. 

## Dataset 

The dataset was downloaded from the NOPD website: "https://data.nola.gov/Public-Safety-and-Preparedness/Electronic-Police-Report-2018/3m97-9vtw". The original dataset has a lot of null data so certain columns had to be disregarded from our analysis

This dataset contains the list of crimes and their details including reason, date, area, and gender
